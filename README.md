# Financial Engineering Resource Hub

> **Note**: This is a practice documentation site created for portfolio purposes. All company names, system details, and data have been sanitized or fictionalized. The patterns and approaches reflect real-world engineering practices.

## Overview

Welcome to the Financial Engineering Resource Hub - a collection of technical documentation for engineers working on financial systems, with a focus on invoicing, billing, and payment infrastructure.

This site demonstrates how to document complex financial systems, onboard new engineers, and maintain operational knowledge for business-critical services.

## What's Inside

### 📚 Documentation Categories

- **[System Architecture](docs/architecture/)** - High-level overviews of invoicing and billing systems
- **[Onboarding Guides](docs/onboarding/)** - Resources for new engineers joining the financial systems team
- **[API Documentation](docs/api/)** - Service contracts, endpoints, and integration patterns
- **[Runbooks](docs/runbooks/)** - Operational procedures and incident response guides
- **[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting/)** - Common issues and resolution strategies
- **[Design Decisions](docs/adr/)** - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) explaining key technical choices

### 🛠 Technologies Covered
