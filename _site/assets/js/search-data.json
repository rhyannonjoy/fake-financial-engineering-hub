Secondary Monitoring: . More #finsys-* channels may be relevant depending on integrations and dependencies. Refer to the IPS Onboarding documentation for a complete list. Dashboard Checks (Optional) . While Slack alerts should cover critical issues, occasional dashboard checks can help identify trends: . | Observability Dashboard: Check for irregular patterns in service metrics | SLO Dashboard: Review daily service availability (not required, but helpful) | . Investigation Guidelines . Priority: Focus on work items that improve operational stability and reduce future incidents. Health Check Outages: . | Services may experience brief outages due to network issues or infrastructure changes | Check audit logs first when investigating outages | Outages recovering in &lt;10 minutes typically don’t require deep investigation | Document patterns if you observe repeated short outages | . Before Restarting Services: . ⚠️ Warning: Always communicate before manually restarting any service. | Post a note in #ips-signals or #ips-dev before proceeding | For production restarts, communication is strongly encouraged | For QA environments, notify QA team to avoid disrupting active testing | . Escalation Path: . | Document investigation in #ips-signals | Tag/ping relevant team members for additional perspective | If unresolved or urgent, escalate to #ips-dev | Add open questions to standup parking lot | .
